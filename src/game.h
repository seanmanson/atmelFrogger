 * The game has 8 rows, numbered 0 to 7 from the bottom. 
 * The frog starts in row 0 (safe) and has to cross 3 lanes
 * of traffic (rows 1 to 3) without being hit by any traffic
 * before arriving at the other side of the road (row 4) 
 * where it is safe. It then has to cross a river by jumping
 * on to logs (rows 5 and 6) before jumping into into a hole
 * on the riverbank (row 7).
 *
 * The functions in this module will update the LED matrix
 * display as required.
